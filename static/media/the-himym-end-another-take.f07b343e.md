# The HIMYM End: Another Take

Okay, spoilers ahead.

How I met your father is starting this week and I was flushed with all the emotions to the prequel series, the one which has made a profound impact on my life. And as always, I was sad for thinking about the ending.

And as I sat in the fast-moving vehicle, looking out of the window, I maybe have looked at another perspective to look at the relationships.

Giving you a buildup simply because I don’t want to right way expose spoilers for all those who haven’t watched it yet. And you never say never.

I think Barney and Robin were never a good couple. Yup, there it is. I have said it. Don’t worry, even my past self is ready to hit me with a bat.

Now that we have removed the emotions (ironic, especially when we are about relationships) here’s another brutal take: Ted and Robin was a good couple only after Robin’s divorce & Tracy’s death.

Firstly, let’s talk about Ted & Robin because dessert is always served last in my stories.

Ted was an old school romantic. He was filled with love, to the brim. No one can take that away from him (except life, which we see in the later seasons). He was searching for his better half because for him, a relationship was all about the “one” with whom life’s just better. And why wouldn't he believe so, I mean, Marshmallow and Lilypad? Do I need to say anything else?

Ted might have been a romantic during his college days, but being present first hand for one of the best relationships, anyone could start believing in love at first sight and the “one”. In fact, even Barney adored the couple. Evident when he asks Lily to stop fooling around in her art internship and when he acts as his doppelganger.

Robin grew up in a strict childhood, making her tough and independent. But, she did have daddy issues - she needed someone who would love her through thick & thin. (Everyone needs someone until they learn to do that for themselves). At the same time, she also loved her independence.

The first time Ted & Robin dated, it was bound to break up because of the different expectations both of them had. Ted wanted a love affair like Marshal & Lily with kids & marriage. For Robin, all that was an obstacle to her independence.

The second time they briefly dated, season 7, their expectations were still the same. And hence they were bound to break up. Ted still wanted everything he wanted in season 2, albeit not that strongly. Robin still loved her independence.

Barney grew up an unloved man as his Dad left him. And then his first girlfriend. And nobody really explained to him that sex isn't an alternative for love. So, he learned how he could and became a womanizer (and a great bro. No, the best bro.)

But as he spent more time with his friends, and reunited with his Dad, he realised another meaning of love. It was about truly caring and sticking with a person and sticking with them through thick and thin. This is why Barney & Robin almost feel like they are made for each other. Almost.

Let’s trace their journey…

Barney & Robin broke up the first time because they were very toxic to each other. Barney was still just understanding the idea of a monogamous relationship & its benefits were far too incomprehensible for him. Robin had understood she valued her independence after breaking up with Ted. But, she still hadn’t grasped her longing for crazy romantic love. Thus, not aware of themselves and the reality around them, they both became toxic to each other.

As time progressed, with Nora and then Later with Quinn, Barney really had grasped the idea of love and he wanted to spend it with the one he really loved — Robin.

When Don took the job Robin had left _for him_, she might have understood that she can never allow anyone to come above her career.
As Barney & Robin started dating, it was now as if they had learned from their previous mistakes and will weather whatever storm comes in their ocean of love.

Everyone was swaying to: Let your heart hold fast... But, as the lyrics go, this too shall pass…

The final chapter of Barney & Robin’s relationship: Marriage, a commitment to put your partner above you, most of the time.

Ted had got all he wanted with Tracy. And yet, as life goes, I feel his time with her was short. For Ted, maybe that relationship felt to last only one season (I know… you’re thinking it too…). But now he was single again.

Barney had learned a lot about love, but the most important lesson was still waiting for him — the idea of letting go. He was ready to handle everything Robin threw at him, but he couldn’t let her go. He couldn't let her be in her career thinking she would run away. It was difficult for him. Because whenever someone left him, he was broken. And he wasn’t ready to be broken again.

Robin was not ready to put someone else above her career especially when things were starting to fly. Not after her breakup with Don. And especially not after knowing what she wants from life.

Thus, they had to go separate ways. Because they knew, the other wasn’t capable of giving what they wanted. _They loved too much to keep on hurting the other._

So, when Robin found Ted again, years after Tracy’s death. And years after Robin’s successful career, they now were a perfect fit.

Barney need time to learn the important lesson of unconditional love — where to love despite the fear of the person leaving you. And the 18 years he must have gotten with his daughter, maybe he did finally find peace.
