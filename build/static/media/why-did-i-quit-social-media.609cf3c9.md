# Why did I quit social media?

![Quit Social Media](/images/blog/essay4-img1.jpeg)

## Aim of the essay

The purpose of this essay is to elaborate my thoughts behind the decision of quitting social media: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Netflix, Prime & Disney+Hotstar ‚Üí all the short-term dopamine spiking apps & activities. The aim is to remind my future self of the reasons for this seemingly drastic decision. And of course, use this as an excuse to hone my writing skills ‚Äî the format of expression I am longing to explore for ages. The aim also is to read this essay at some point in the future & see the flaws in my thoughts & reasoning.

## Not why should you quit too?

The aim is not to convince you, the reader to quit social media. It is not a guide on why you should experiment with me, and explore the benefits & harmful side effects together‚Ä¶ It is not about documenting my experience while on the journey. It is not about justifying my views about a certain way of the working of the society these days and convincing you on the same. There are many videos out there that do it: link

It is wholly, solely and ultimately an essay just to document why I arrived at a certain conclusion, what were the factors behind it and to ensure that I stick to my choice with proper reason. And truth be told, I doubt I would be able to stick to it‚Ä¶ And precisely that‚Äôs the reason for this essay as an expression of my choices and an attempt to convince my future self.

At the same time, I don‚Äôt want to make it a motivational blog post either where there are a lot of words and sensible statements, but no connection between them.

## How did I stumble upon this idea?

My previous phone, the awesome Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1, fell into a bucket full of water. And I lost most of my data, with my Instagram backup code ‚Äî yup, not the password, not the connected email id, not the phone number, the backup codes. I was locked out of Instagram even though having everything. And creating a new profile was well, daunting.

Now, like any new phone owner, I knew deep in my heart, the new phone was not a bad omen. Hey, new is always better.

I thus concluded that I was presented with a very rare opportunity. I chose to skip Instagram for a while. Also because deep down, I knew it was my time leak.

## Off Instagram: Experience

There was no difference for me. No FOMO. No addiction symptoms. Because Instagram was replaced with Asphalt 8 & YouTube & Facebook. But, I was bored quickly on Asphalt ( No bro, I did not start losing the races as I levelled up üôà). And also with Facebook where Angel Priya‚Äôs the only one active these days. So, YouTube was my lifeline. But being accustomed to surfing Youtube on my laptop it still was not a big difference. Slowly, YouTube became my go-to for long breaks & scrolling between the app list, the short breaks.

With increased boredom and time to kill while eating KitKats, I finally decided to open my books. They were boring at the start. But just like memes, I moved past the boring ones & re-read the ones I enjoyed.

## Off Instagram: The FOMO

After some time, the Fear of Missing Out started to kick in. I did not know where some of my socially active friends were, what new thing was happening in their lives ‚Äî new movies watched, new places visited, new people they met. With Instagram, I was a silent spectator in their life. A fan cheering for the glorified version of their life. But as time progressed FOMO was managed. The close ones were always in touch. I focused more on my life and what I wanted to do in it. I started engaging in things & content I really wanted to be engrossed in.

## Mindless Scrolling

> _Life was now to be pursued; it would not show up on my feed._

Or would it?

I have different versions of myself, at different times of the day. I enjoy [Hardy Sandhu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qs2dZO6wcc), [Eminem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yhyp-_hX2s), [Divine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCshJBODT4) & [Seige](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9518QrtUYV8) in the morning. I want motivation energy and direction. In the evening, the melodious [Hardy Sandhu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4KngXtOlNo), [Arijit, and Pritam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh66Pjtqr4k) make the bike rides memorable. I don‚Äôt want to watch Ryan Reynolds sarcasm in the morning or React Js tutorials in the evening. So, I would open the platform and scroll through the fun videos till I reached the type of videos I wanted to watch. And in between the opening of the app and reaching my type of videos, was the sneaky devil...

I spent time on social media to view the type of content I wanted. And when I opened the apps, I sometimes got lost in the fun videos. And it was not good, especially when you had difficult tasks at hand.

Social media [fools your brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk) to think you are doing something important when scrolling through social media. But in fact, you are just scrolling as you are not getting out anything from it most of the time. And it‚Äôs not just Instagram & Social media ‚Äî Netflix & Prime videos also play a huge role with their never-ending options & creating decision fatigue. Making your brain so tired that you don‚Äôt notice you have spent 2 hours picking up a movie of 1.5 hrs. I don‚Äôt see this as a fair deal.

So I decided to abstain from social media. And the results?

## Abstaining from mindless scrolling:

Getting more ideas. My brain had the time to be bored. Or well, rest. It had the time to process the data it consumed & convert it into information.

> _Our brains are for having ideas. Not storing them._

Yup, our brains are lousy storage systems. But, here‚Äôs the secret (ü§´ ), you don‚Äôt have to use your brains for storage. Sure, the villain of [S3E3 of Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Last_Vow) did it, and so did Sherlock. But unless you are competing with a fictional character or an aspiring detective, I think you‚Äôd be better off by using a simpler storage device like (gasp)‚Ä¶ phones! (Side note: Sherlock and the villain did not store everything. Only what they deemed important. Sensible information. Not data)

One should be very careful about what one puts in the mind. Ideas are like songs. Once stuck, they are really difficult to get out of your head. When not constantly bombarded with data, I had very few ideas. But when I broke from the mindless scrolling loop, my brain became an idea generation machine. Of course, not all of the ideas were good. (But all of my jokes were‚Ä¶ regardless of what people say).

> _To become a good chef, you should have the resources & the demand to cook._

When overflowing with ideas, difficult problems did not seem difficult anymore. as I had ideas, Even if stupid, I had ideas to approach the problems & execute them. I am not saying that I got better at solving problems. No, but having ideas gave me enough motivation to try the difficult (or rather seemingly difficult) problems & churn out more work. With better quality.

## The ultimate purpose of productivity: using systems & fÃ∂aÃ∂iÃ∂lÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂g achieving goals‚Ä¶

With other confidence after solving hard problems, I was now ready to tackle the ultimate problem: bring back the _Kohinoor to India (Britishers are thieves)‚Ä¶_ The dreams I had given up because they felt daunting, were now calling me.

As I devised plans with my idea generation factory working properly now, the obstacles I thought I had were breaking down. Being off mindless scrolling & social media, I was retraining my brain to not expect success every 15 seconds. Focus on my long term goals became easier as I gave them realistic deadlines to achieve the goals. Okay, maybe I got only a little bit better‚Ä¶

## Compounding: The 8th wonder üî• & My Plan

Mindless scrolling eats up small bits of time. The time that could have been used for the large goal you have. For example, instead of watching a TV series, I am writing this blog. I am not saying you shouldn‚Äôt watch. I am saying those 30 mins you spend scrolling while deciding what to watch if added every day for a year become one complete week.

> üí° 30mins \* 365 days = 10,950 mins

> üí° 10, 950 mins = 182.5 hours

> üí° 182.5 hours = 7.6 days

And a lot can happen in 30 mins. You cannot become an established blog writer. But, you can create an outline for your essay. Which can then turn into a blog post.

You can cook Maggi and eat it.

You can watch an episode of How I Met Your Mother while eating that bowl of Maggi.

You can call me and share how it is better, so much better than Friends.

The point is, the small minutes on social media added up amounts to a huge chunk.

## Journey üßó Not Destination üèî

Of course, you don‚Äôt spend 30 mins like me. You spend 2‚Äì5 mins. Those 2 minutes help you recharge & refocus. Those two minutes can also get in touch with a friend on social media by sharing a meme. And I agree ‚Äî Social Media is a new age tool. It‚Äôs out there for our benefit. But, when was the last time you really connected with a friend on social media? Maybe once or twice?

Yes, it works 1‚Äì2 times, but do those 2 times justify the countless hours you spend on it? Yes, hours. Go ahead, check your screen time. Now justify the average of 2 hours on Instagram you spent even though you had a busy week.

The idea is to look at those small intervals not to fill them with boring memes & posts about the happening life of others. It is about filling them with what you really love. No bro, you might like memes and you might like dark comedy ‚Äî but what you really love is using those jokes in conversations.

Social media is always just a touch away in your phone. And you are up to date with all the memes & news & that friend who got into IIM Ahmedabad or Harvard. But all that data, is it really important?

Let‚Äôs look at the power of 2 minutes. Say you want to learn guitar. In the first scenario, you have it in your hands all day & play it at every interval you got. In scenario 2, you plan to practice it every Tuesday at 7 pm. In which scenario do you have a better chance of learning a guitar?

> And the idea is to replace the passively engaging activity of social media with the small task of your big dream. Not giving it a fixed slot in your schedule. Which is not always possible.

Think about what if, you had a book in your arms. Not a boring book, not the best seller. The one which you really enjoy. Now for your breaks, what if you saw reading it like a recharge? Can I assume you‚Äôd finish it in one month? And would you not learn a lot from it?

## Argument: Concise Information.

Yes, I hear you. Social media keeps you updated with a lot of information. And insights. Then, why should you read books when you can read the summary in a post?

For the sociopaths who hate life and reading: What would you prefer? To eat a tablet that delivers all your required nutrients once a day? Or a full course meal? It‚Äôs about enjoying the process of learning. Yes, you have to eat a tablet when you are sick. But you don‚Äôt want to be sick all the time, do you?

## Argument: Algorithm Training

And I am not against [eating the tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoWL1Td5upY) (Because who does not adore [Captain Holt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDhsYABUjVc?), I am against eating the wrong tablet.

The ideal feed of your social media should uplift you, teach you, inspire you and on during non-working time, it‚Äôs boring.

Because only a sociopath does not relish at least one meme every time they open Instagram. Yes, you can train the algorithm to work towards your goals, but it becomes interesting only when there are some memes. And that‚Äôs my concern.

In the long run, we end up liking & paying attention to more memes than informational posts. Hence, I would suggest relying on training the algorithm to give you educational content in between. But half-baked learning takes a lot of time.

The feed is a program you train to show better stuff by following the accounts you want & regularly searching the stuff you want to know about. But, as most of you might have realised, the algorithm takes a lot of time to understand you. And until now, you have been training it to do something else (show you sassy videos).

Till the algorithm understands me completely, I want to ensure that I am not exposed to stuff I don‚Äôt want to be exposed to, like this [song](https://youtu.be/T_mtTxmjpwc) I was into it for a time duration I cannot proudly admit. (it was a long time‚Ä¶ And I found out my colleagues have real patience.)

To train your algorithm, you have to know what you want and what you don‚Äôt want. And the method I am using here is the method I use for my girlfriends. I just stay away for a while and the one I miss the most receives my texts. Others, not so much.

## Conclusion:

_HIMYM is better than FRIENDS._ My bad, I thought this rant was about something else.

In conclusion, I am staying away from social media not because [I want to not move along with the crowd](https://youtu.be/O_whGoi_Q8Y), but I also want to see what happens when you don‚Äôt let a multi-billion dollar corporation choose which cringe [song](https://youtu.be/DwUgoUhgzLo) gets stuck in my head.

I want to see if compounding makes a real difference to my reading lists, my goals and my life.
